## 🧭 About the Program

The **Data Engineering Zoomcamp** is a free and open-source course created by DataTalks.Club.  
It provides a comprehensive, hands-on journey into the tools and best practices used by modern data engineers.  

Over several weeks, it covers key topics such as:
- Data ingestion
- Orchestration and scheduling
- Data warehousing with BigQuery
- Data modeling with dbt
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Batch processing with Spark
- and more!

## 🚀 Final Project: OptiFund

📌 In my final project, OptiFund, I built a data pipeline to:
- Ingest global financial indices from Yahoo Finance
- Store data in GCS, process it with BigQuery
- Transform insights using dbt
- Visualize correlations and returns in Looker Studio

## Why hire me?

Through the Data Engineering Zoomcamp, I have acquired a solid foundation in the core components of data engineering:

- Cloud infrastructure (GCP)
- Data ingestion and orchestration (Kestra)
- Batch and streaming processing (Spark, Kafka)
- Data warehousing and transformation (BigQuery, dbt)
- Production-ready pipelines with Terraform and Docker

💼 With a strong engineering background and pedagogical experience, I bring a pragmatic, structured, and communicative approach to building data solutions.

🚀 I love turning raw data into actionable insights and designing efficient pipelines that scale.

📈 I’m particularly interested in use cases like anomaly detection, financial risk prediction, and industrial optimization.

👉 If you're looking for someone who can own your data workflow end-to-end—from ingestion to insights—I’m [ready to help](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasseur2valeurs/)!
